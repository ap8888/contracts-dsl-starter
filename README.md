# üßæ Contracts DSL Starter

A modular **TypeScript-based framework** for building, evaluating, and rendering **domain-specific languages (DSL)** for legal and procurement contracts.  
Designed for automation, clause management, and jurisdiction-aware contract generation.

## üß† Core Concept

The system uses a **facts + rules + clauses + renderers** model:

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Facts** | JSON representation of contract metadata, parties, and context (e.g., `facts.msa-nl.json`) |
| **Rules** | JSON definitions for procurement or jurisdictional logic (`jurisdiction.nl.json`, `procurement.twoEnvelope.json`) |
| **Clauses** | Markdown-based reusable legal clauses (`clause.gdpr.controller_processor.md`) |
| **Core** | Type definitions, clause loader, evaluation engine, and logic interpreter |
| **Renderers** | Converters for HTML and DOCX outputs |
| **CLI** | Command-line interface to generate, test, and render contracts |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/contracts-dsl-starter.git
cd contracts-dsl-starter
npm install
```

---

## üß© Usage

### 1. Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Run the CLI
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Example: generate a contract
```bash
node packages/cli/src/index.js --facts examples/facts.msa-nl.json --render html
```

The system will:
- Parse input facts  
- Match applicable rules and clauses  
- Render the contract into `/out` as `msa-nl.html`

## üß± Example: Clause Definition

`packages/clauses/clause.gdpr.controller_processor.md`
```markdown
### Data Processing and GDPR Compliance

The Parties agree that data processing activities shall comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679).
The Controller ensures that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently.
```

## üß∞ Example: Rule Definition

`packages/rules/jurisdiction.nl.json`
```json
{
  "jurisdiction": "NL",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "governingLaw": "Dutch Civil Code",
  "defaultClauses": [
    "clause.governing_law.nl.md",
    "clause.gdpr.controller_processor.md"
  ]
}
```

---

## üß© Example: Facts File

`examples/facts.msa-nl.json`
```json
{
  "type": "MSA",
  "jurisdiction": "NL",
  "parties": {
    "buyer": "Company A",
    "supplier": "Company B"
  },
  "procurementModel": "twoEnvelope",
  "services": ["IT Infrastructure", "Maintenance"]
}
```

## üñ®Ô∏è Renderers

| Renderer | Output | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `htmlRenderer.ts` | `.html` | Generates formatted HTML contracts |
| `docxRenderer.ts` | `.docx` | Generates editable Word documents |
